This package uses the Thai Font Adjustor package which developed and copyrighted by SaladLab. 

The original repository :
https://github.com/SaladbowlCreative/Unity3D.ThaiFontAdjuster/releases

Limitation : 
- ThaiFontAdjuster only can handle special fonts.
Font should have extended glyphs from U+F700 to U+F71A providing various position of Thai characters.
- Modified NotoSansThai containing extended glyphs is included in this package.
- If you want to use another font, check it contains extended glyphs, otherwise glyphs have to be added to font by yourself.
